# H.E.R DAO HACKER HOUSE PREP

There will be many hands-on presentations at the hacker house. Make sure you have these things installed on your machine! :)
### 0) Have a seperate wallet for developing. Do not use your regular wallet!

### 1) VSCode
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2) Git
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* You can check if you already have it installed by running this command in your terminal
```bash
git --version
```

Git Commands To Know

* Fork -> when you visit a github repository, there is a "fork" button, this means you create your own copy of the codebase onto your (remote) github page.

* `git clone` -> this will download an existing codebase on github onto your local machine (your computer) so that you can modify/edit/run it. (this is how to collaborate)
```
git clone [insert repo url]
```
* Typically, in a workshop presentation, they will share a github repository link. You should first fork it and then clone it on to your machine.

### 3) Get familiar with Solidity! (I recommend lessons 1-6 of crypto zombies, it'll get you used to the syntax and how smart contracts / the blockchain works. You can finish this tutorial in 1-2 days.)
* Learn solidity: https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/
* If you want a more hands-on approach, I recommend Alchemy's Road To Web3 where they provide project-based learning + video tutorials: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3
* If you want a fullstack blockchain tutorial, I recommend:

# Front-End Development Must Haves
* Download node.js & npm
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) -> when you install node, npm comes with it so that's all you need!
* You can check if you already have it installed by running these commands in your terminal

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
